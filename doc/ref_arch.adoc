== Overview
Red Hat's Business Process Management (BPM) Suite 6 product is a super-set of it's Business Rules Management (BRM) Suite 6 product.
As such both products include a rules engine (based on technology from the open-source Drools community projects).
BPM Suite 6 includes an _Execution Server_ that allows for remote invocation of its process engine only.
The BPM Suite 6 Execution Server does not allow for remote invocation of its rules engine.

The purpose of this reference architecture is to provide a remoteable API to invoke the rules engine of BPM Suite 6.

There are several components to the example solution provided in this reference architecture.
Some of the components are generic and should not need additional customization.
Other components are application specific and will require customization.
As you are going through this reference architecture, please pay particular attention to those components that require customization on your part.

=== Directory Structure
This reference architecture includes the following directories:

. *common*
+
This reference architecture includes an {irulesmgmt} interface.
This IRulesMgmt interface is implemented by a CDI bean that manages the rules engine assigned to a _Deployment Unit_ .
The IRulesMgmt interface and CDI bean implementation are generic and should not require customization.
+
This reference architecture also includes an {irulesmgmtservice} interface.
Its implementation is an EJB that wraps transaction and remoting capabilties around the core rules management CDI bean.
This IRulesMgmtService is also generic and should not require customization.
If your application makes use of EJB clients (either local or remote), then this is the interface to invoke.

. *domain*
+
Example application domain model classes used in this reference architecture to demonstrate capability of Rules Management API functionality.
These example domain model classes contain JAXB annotations for (un)marshalling between its XML and java object representations.
JAXB annotations in your domain model are a requirement if using the RESTful API provided by this reference architecture.

. *processTier*
+
Example KIE project that includes a single rule.
This example KIE project is invoked by remote clients via the rules management API functionality provided in this reference architecture.

. *rulesMgmt*:  Provides the following:
.. Rules Management CDI bean
+
Similar to the existing BPM Suite 6 Execution Server, this Rules Management CDI bean is _Deployment Unit_ aware.
The Rules Management CDI bean is generic in the sense that its API specifies java.lang.Object to insert facts and globals into the working memory of the rules engine.
The Rules Management CDI bean can be wrapped and exposed using a variety of different transports.
ie:  A user of this reference architecture may elect to expose this Rules Management CDI bean as a SOAP and/or JMS service.

.. Rules Management EJB Service
+
Allows for local and/or remote EJB clients to invoke the Rules Management API in a performant, transactional manner.

.. Rules Management RESTful service
+
Allows for invocation of the Rules Management API via http.
Introduces over-head of JAXB (un)marshalling of an applications domain model.

=== Rules Management Topics
. *Deployment Unit aware*
+ 
Similar to the existing BPM Suite 6 Execution Server, the Rules Management CDI bean is _Deployment Unit_ aware.
KIE projects are deployed as per your normal procedures using BPM Suite 6.
KIE Base and KIE Session specifics are configured during creation of the deployment unit.
The Rules Management CDI bean then manages the rules engine assigned to that deployment unit.

. *Supports Stateful and Stateless KIESessions*
+
The majority of rules use-cases benefit from a stateful KIESession.
Some use-cases however are better served with a stateless KIESession where the life of the session is a single transaction.
When using a stateless session, all commands to that session (ie:  insert fact, global, fireAllRules, etc) need to occur within the scope of that transaction.
This reference architecture provides an API that allows for interaction with either a stateful or stateless session.


. *API*
+
The API provided by the Rules Management CDI bean is straight-forward.
Details of each function can be found in the {irulesmgmt} interface.

. *Domain Model Classes*
+
Add your domain model classes to the classpath of the business-central web archive of BPM Suite 6.
This is typically done via either of the following:

.. add domain model libraries to business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
.. deploy your doman model libraries as static JBoss modules and define an explicit dependency in the business-central web archive to this static JBoss module.



== Pre-Requisites

. Experience with BPM Suite 6 and in particular the rules engine functionality.
. BPM Suite 6 environment configured to use one its supported relational databases.
. git
. maven 3.*
+
maven should be configured to use the BPM Suite 6 and JBoss EAP 6.1.1 maven repositories.
. curl

== Set-up

. clone this reference architecture
+
-----
git clone https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_rulesMgmt.git
-----
+
NOTE:  for the purposes of this reference architecture documentation, this new directory created from having cloned this project will be referred to as: $REF_ARCH_HOME .

. build and install this reference architecture
+
-----
cd $REF_ARCH_HOME
mvn clean install -DskipTests
-----

. copy project libraries to _business-central_ web archive
+
-----
cp domain/target/bpm_rulesMgmt_domain.jar $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
cp common/target/bpm_rulesMgmt_common.jar $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
cp rulesMgmt/target/bpm_rulesMgmt.jar $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
-----

. start BPM Suite 6
. clone this reference architecture in BPM Suite 6
. deploy the _processTier_ KIE project included in this reference architecture.
+ 
NOTE: the deployment unit id will be:  com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_rulesMgmt:processTier:1.0

== Test
This reference architecture includes a RESTful interface to manage the rules engine assigned to a Deployment Unit.

=== Test Details

. *curl*
+
Because this reference architecture provides an example RESTful interface, the command line curl utility is used to show-case this RESTful API.
Any http client that allows for GET, POST and DELETE functions can be used, however.

. *docker_bpms*
+
The test examples reference a DNS name of:  _docker_bpms_.
_docker_bpms_ is the name of the host where BPM Suite 6 is running.
You will want to customize these example commands to use the IP address or DNS name of the host where your BPM Suite 6 environment is running. 

. *BPM Suite 6 BASIC Auth*
+
The test examples reference a curl command-line parameter of:  *-u jboss:brms* .
_ jboss:brms_  is the userId:password used by the curl utility to authenticate to the _business-central_ web archive of BPM Suite 6.
You will want to customize the value of -u userId:password so that curl can authenticate to your BPM Suite 6 environment.

. *Directory from which to execute the test commands*
+
The test examples assume that they are being executed from the root directory of this reference architecture.
