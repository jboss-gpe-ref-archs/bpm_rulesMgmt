= BPM Rules Management

:numbered:

== Overview
Red Hat's Business Process Management (BPM) Suite 6 product is a super-set of it's Business Rules Management (BRM) Suite 6 product.
As such both products include a rules engine (based on technology from the open-source Drools community projects).
BPM Suite 6 includes an _Execution Server_ that allows for remote invocation of its process engine only.

The purpose of this reference architecture is to provide examples on how to invoke the rules engine of BPM Suite 6.

. Please contact Red Hat to discuss support details for Red Hat's BPM Suite 6 product.


=== Rules Management Topics
. *Deployment Unit aware*
+ 
KIE projects are deployed as per your normal procedures using BPM Suite 6.
KIE Base and KIE Session specifics are configured during creation of the deployment unit.

+
Deployment Units are a BPM Suite 6 concept only.
Deployment unit functionality is not applicable to BRM Suite 6.


. *Scoped KIESessions*
+
Many rules use-cases benefit from a SINGLETON KIESession whose scope is the life of a BPM Suite 6 Deployment Unit.
Some use-cases however are better served with a PER_REQUEST KIE session where the life of the session is a single transaction.
When using a PER_REQUEST session, all commands to that session (ie:  insert fact, global, fireAllRules, etc) need to occur within the scope of that transaction.
Since a PER_REQUEST KIE Session will never be re-used, its state is not persisted to a database as it is with SINGLETON and PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE strategies.
A PER_REQUEST KIE Session incurs minimal over-head and allows for concurrency.


. *Domain Model Classes*
+
Add your domain model classes to the java classpath of the business-central web archive of BPM Suite 6.
This is typically done via either of the following:

.. add domain model libraries to business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
.. add domain model libraries to kie-server.war/WEB-INF/lib
.. deploy your doman model libraries as static JBoss modules and define an explicit dependency in the business-central and kie-server web archives to this static JBoss module.

+
Related, there is not a need to define dependencies to your domain model classes in the pom.xml of your KIE project.
You may choose to define dependencies to your domain model in the pom.xml of your KIE project (ie:  for design-time requirements imposed by the various editors of the BPM Console).
However, this reference architecture does not inspect the classpath created by the KIE project when resolving classes .... only the java classpath.


=== Directory Structure
This reference architecture includes the following directories:

. *domain*
+
Example application domain model classes used in this reference architecture to demonstrate capability of Execution Server functionality.
These example domain model classes contain JAXB annotations for (un)marshalling between its XML and java object representations.

. *processTier*
+
Example KIE project that includes a single rule.
This example KIE project is invoked by remote clients via the Execution Server functionality provided by BPM Suite 6.

. *rulesMgmt*
+
Provides tests and xml used to call the rest endpoint. Also there is a soapUI project file that shows how to call the _Execution Server_.


== Pre-Requisites
The remainder of this documentation provides instructions for installation, configuration and execution of this reference architecture in Red Hat's Partner Demo System.
The following is a list of pre-requisites:

. OPENTLC-SSO credentials
+
`OPENTLC-SSO` user credentials are used to log into the Red Hat Partner Demo System (PDS).
If you do not currently have an `OPENTLC-SSO` userId, please email: `OPEN-program@redhat.com`.

. Familiarity with Partner Demo System
+
If you are not already familiar with Red Hat's `Partner Demo System`, please execute what is detailed in the {mwlaboverviewsetup} guide.
Doing so will ensure that you are proficient with the tooling and workflow needed to complete this reference architecture in an OpenShift Platform as a Service environment.

. Familiarity with {bpmproduct}
. curl
. {soapui}

== Provision BPM Suite 6 application

. Open the `Openshift Explorer` panel of the `JBoss` perspective of JBDS
. Right-click on the previously created connection to `broker00.ose.opentlc.com`.
+
Using your `OPENTLC-SSO` credentials, a connection to `broker00.ose.opentlc.com` should already exist after having completed the {mwlaboverviewsetup} guide.

. Select: `New -> Application` .
+
Since you have already created a domain from the previous introductory lab, the workflow for creation of a new application will be slightly different than what you are used to.
In particular, the OSE plugin will not prompt you for the creation of a new domain.

. The following `New or existing OpenShift Application` pop-up should appear:
+
image::images/new_OSE_app_bpm.png[]

.. In the `Name` text box, enter: `bpmsapp`
.. From the `Type` drop-down, select: JBoss BPMS 6.0 (rhgpe-bpms-6.0)
.. From the `Gear profile` drop-down, select: pds_medium
. Click `Next`
. A new dialogue appears entitled `Set up Project for new OpenShift Aplication`.
+
Check the check box for `Disable automatic maven build when pushing to OpenShift`.
Afterwards, Click `Next`.

. A new dialogue appears entitled `Import an existing OpenShift application`.
+
Even though it will not be used, you will be forced to clone the remote git enabled project associated with your new OpenShift application.
Select a location on your local filesystem where the git enabled project should be cloned to.
+
image::images/gitclonelocation_bpm.png[]

. Click `Finish`
. The OSE plugin of JBDS will spin for a couple of minutes as the remote BPM Suite 6 enabled OpenShift application is created.
. Eventually, the OSE plugin will prompt with a variety of pop-up related details regarding your new application.
+
Click through all of them except when you come to the dialogue box entitled `Publish bpmsapp?`.
For this dialogue box, click `No`
+
image::images/publishbpmslab.png[]

=== BPM Suite 6 App Verification

. Using the `Remote System Explorer` perspective of JBDS, open an SSH terminal and tail the `bpms/standalone/log/server.log` of your remote BPM Suite 6 enabled OSE application
. Log messages similar to the following should appear:
+
image::images/newbpmlogfile.png[]

== Configuration and Execution

=== local: Clone this reference architecture
This reference architecture will be cloned both in your local computer as well as in your remote BPM Suite 6 Openshift environment.
To clone this reference architecture in your local environment, execute the following:

. Open the `Git` perspective of JBDS.
. In the `Git Repositories` panel, click the link that allows you to `Clone a Git Repository and add the clone to this view`
. A pop-up should appear with a name of `Source Git Repository`
. In the `URI` field, enter the following:
+
-----
https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_rulesMgmt.git
-----

. Click `Next`
+
image::images/clone_repo_to_local.png[]

. Continue to click `Next` through the various screens
+
On the pop-up screen entitled `Local Destination`, change the default value of the `Directory` field to your preferred location on disk.
For the purposes of the remainder of these instructions, this directory on your local filesystem will be referred to as:  $REF_ARCH_HOME

. On the last screen of the `Clone Git Repository` pop-up, click `Finish`
+
Doing so will clone this `bpm_rulesMgmt` project to your local disk

. In JBDS, switch to the `Project Explorer` panel and navigate to:  `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects`
. In the `Root Directory` field of the `Maven Projects` pop-up, navigate to the location on disk where the `bpm_rulesMgmt` project was just cloned to.
+
image::images/import_mvn_project.png[]

. Click `next` through the various pop-up panels and finally `Finish`.
. Your `Project Explorer` panel should now include the following mavenized projects
+
image::images/maven_projects.png[]

=== local: Build the Reference Architecture
This reference architecture includes various sub-projects that need to be built locally.
To build the various sub-projects, execute the following:

. In the `Project Explorer` panel of JBDS, right-click on the `parent` project
. Navigate to: `Run As -> Maven Install`
. In the `Console` panel, a `BUILD SUCCESS` log message should appear.
+
image::images/maven_build_success.png[]

=== BPM Suite 6: Deployment
Now that this reference architecture has been built locally, its artifacts need to be added to the classpath of the `business-central.war` and `kie-server.war` web applications of the remote BPM Suite 6 enabled OpenShift application.

. Repeat these steps for the domain artifact:

* $REF_ARCH_HOME/domain/target/bpm_rulesMgmt_domain.jar

.. In the `Project Explorer` panel of the `JBOSS` perspective of JBDS, right-click on the `domain/target/bpm_rulesMgmt_domain.jar` in `Project Explorer` and select `Copy`.
+
image::images/domainjar.png[]

.. In the `Remote System Explorer` perspective of JBDS, navigate to `bpmsapp-<your domain>.apps.ose.opentlc.com -> Sftp Files -> My Home -> bpms -> standalone -> deployments -> business-central.war -> WEB-INF -> lib`
.. Right-click and select `Paste`
.. Repeat the same for `kie-server.war/WEB-INF/lib` folder, copying the `bpm_rulesMgmt_domain.jar` file.
+
image::images/pastedomainjarintobizcentral.png[]

. Once the artifact have been added to the `WEB-INF/lib` directories of your remote BPM Suite 6 app, re-start the JVM:
.. Switch back to the `OpenShift Explorer` plugin of JBDS and right-click the `bpmsapp` application
.. Select `Restart Application`

=== BPM Suite 6: clone this Ref Arch
This reference architecture contains a few simple rules that can be used to smoke-test the `bpm_rulesMgmt` services.

. Navigate your browser to the BPM Console of your remote OpenShift application.
. Authenticate using a userId of `jboss` and a password of `brms`.
. clone this reference architecture in BPM Suite 6 and name the new git repository:  _bpmrulesmgmt_
. build the _processTier_ KIE project included in this reference architecture.
+

-----
curl -vv -u jboss:brms -X POST http://bpmsapp-<your.domain.name>.apps.ose.opentlc.com/business-central/rest/repositories/bpmrulesmgmt/projects/processTier/maven/compile
-----

response:

[source,json]
----
{"jobId":"1430254875257-2","status":"APPROVED","repositoryName":"bpmrulesmgmt","projectName":"processTier"}
----

== Test
This reference architecture includes a {soapui-file} based on SoapUI to execute commands (REST requests) directly to the _Execution Server_. Take attention to the url used for the methods and the credentials should be both modified.

=== Test Details

. *curl*
+
Because this reference architecture provides some examples of how to call the _Execution Server_, the command line curl utility is used to show-case this RESTful API.
Any http client that allows for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE functions can be used, however. 

. *bpmsapp-gpe.apps.ose.opentlc.com*
+
The test examples reference a DNS name of:  _bpmsapp-gpe.apps.ose.opentlc.com_.
+
_bpmsapp-gpe.apps.ose.opentlc.com_ is the name of the host where BPM Suite 6 is running when this reference architecture was created.
You will want to customize these example commands to use the IP address or DNS name of the host where your BPM Suite 6 environment is running. 

. *BPM Suite 6 BASIC Auth*
+
The test examples reference a curl command-line parameter of:  *-u jboss:brms*.
+
_jboss:brms_  is the userId:password used by the curl utility to authenticate to the _business-central_ web archive of BPM Suite 6.
You will want to customize the value of -u userId:password so that curl can authenticate to your BPM Suite 6 environment.

. *Directory from which to execute the test commands*
+
The test examples assume that they are being executed from a command terminal at the root directory of this reference architecture ($REF_ARCH_HOME).

=== Sample RESTful Test Commands

*sanity check*:  ensure that the REST service is properly started:

-----
curl -v -u jboss:brms -X GET http://bpmsapp-gpe.apps.ose.opentlc.com/kie-server/services/rest/server/
-----

response:  

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><response type="SUCCESS" msg="Kie Server info"><kie-server-info><version>6.2.0.Final-redhat-3</version></kie-server-info></response>
-----

==== SINGLETON KIE Session
A SINGLETON KIE session is the default session strategy.
This session strategy provides a single KIE Session whose scope is a deployment unit.
Operations on a SINGLETON KIE session (ie:  setGlobal, insertFact, fireAllRules, etc) are synchronized.
This strategy is ideal for rules use cases that involve large number of facts and rules where it is desirable that the session not be disposed.

. *deploy a KIE project and specify SINGLETON session strategy*:
Before executing the following command, ensure that a previous deployment unit with the same GAV does not already exist.
