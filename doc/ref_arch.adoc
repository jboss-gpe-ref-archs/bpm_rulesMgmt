== Overview
Red Hat's Business Process Management (BPM) Suite 6 product is a super-set of it's Business Rules Management (BRM) Suite 6 product.
As such both products include a rules engine (based on technology from the open-source Drools community projects).
BPM Suite 6 includes an _Execution Server_ that allows for remote invocation of its process engine only.
The BPM Suite 6 Execution Server does not allow for remote invocation of its rules engine.

The purpose of this reference architecture is to provide a remoteable API to invoke the rules engine of BPM Suite 6.

There are several components to the example solution provided in this reference architecture.
Some of the components are generic and should not need additional customization.
Other components are application specific and will require customization.
As you are going through this reference architecture, please pay particular attention to those components that require customization on your part.

=== Directory Structure
This reference architecture includes the following directories:

. *domain*
+
Example application domain model classes used in this reference architecture to demonstrate capability of Rules Management API functionality.
These example domain model classes contain JAXB annotations for (un)marshalling between its XML and java object representations.
JAXB annotations in your domain model are not a requirement.
The end-state is the ability to (un)marshall your domain model classes so as to be used as _facts_ and _globals_ in the working memory of the BPM Suite 6 rules engine.
As an application developer, you are responsible for how your domain model is best (un)marshalled to/from its Java object representation.

. *interfaces*
+
This reference architecture includes an {irulesmgmt} interface.
This IRulesMgmt interface is implemented by a CDI bean that manages the rules engine assigned to a _Deployment Unit_ .
The IRulesMgmt interface and CDI bean implementation are generic and should not require customization.

+
This reference architecture also includes an {irulesmgmtservice} interface.
Its implementation is an EJB that wraps transaction and remoting capabilties around the core rules management CDI bean.
This IRulesMgmtService is also generic and should not require customization.
 
. *processTier*
+
Example KIE project that includes a single rule.
This example KIE project is invoked by remote clients via the rules management API functionality provided in this reference architecture.

. *rulesMgmt*:  Provides the following:
.. Rules Management CDI bean
+
Similar to the existing BPM Suite 6 Execution Server, this Rules Management CDI bean is _Deployment Unit_ aware.
The Rules Management CDI bean is generic in the sense that its API specifies java.lang.Object to insert facts and globals into the working memory of the rules engine.

.. Example application-specific rules mgmt service
+
The Rules Management CDI bean can be wrapped and exposed using a variety of transports.
A user of this reference architecture may elect to expose this Rules Management CDI bean as a SOAP and/or JMS service.
In this reference architecture, an example RESTful service is provided.
This RESTful service is application specific.
JAXB (un)marshalling of the included application-specific domain model occurs in this application specific RESTful service.
It is expected that a user of this reference architecture will customize this RESTful interface or create their own.

=== Rules Management Topics
. *Deployment Unit aware*
+ 
Similar to the existing BPM Suite 6 Execution Server, the Rules Management CDI bean is _Deployment Unit_ aware.
KIE projects are deployed as per your normal procedures using BPM Suite 6.
KIE Base and KIE Session specifics are configured during creation of the deployment unit.
The Rules Management CDI bean then manages the rules engine assigned to that deployment unit.


. *API*
+
The API provided by the Rules Management CDI bean is straight-forward.
Details of each function of the API can be found in the {irulesmgmt} interface.


== Pre-Requisites

. Experience with BPM Suite 6 and in particular the rules engine functionality.
. BPM Suite 6 environment configured to use one its supported relational databases.
. git
. maven 3.*
+
maven should be configured to use the BPM Suite 6 and JBoss EAP 6.1.1 maven repositories.
